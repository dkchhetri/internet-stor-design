1. generate SSH key
   # ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/my-storN-key
   It will create,
      ~/my-storN-key       <== make sure this is saved at secure location and is readable only to you
      ~/my-storN-key.pub

2. login to pumkin server (using your LDAP/NIS credentials)
   It will ask you for following,
      unique-stor-name: MAX len 255 char
        Chose a unique name for your stor (you may use some convention, for e.g.
        <department>-<user name>-<descriptive stor name, describes what you will
        be storing here>)
      ssh-key:
        upload ~/my-storN-key.pub

3. sync your local-directories up-stream (for first time)
   # pumkin stor sync key:~/my-storN-key.pub from:<path of directories to sync> to:<stor url>

   If you want to "tag" this version, then you can do so by using version suffix to files
   you are synching as follow,
     <path name>#<tag-name>

4. Make some changes to your local files, and then sync again
   # pumkin stor sync key:~/my-storN-key.pub from:<path of directories to sync> to:<stor url>

5. unfortunatley, you lost some files and want to retrieve it back from stor
   # pumkin stor sync key:~/my-storN-key.pub from:<stor url> to:<file/directories to retrieve>
   To retrieve version as-of-date, then you can use the following syntax to specify version
     <path>#<date in epoch seconds> / <path>#<tag-name>
