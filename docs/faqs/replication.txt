1. How many copy does server make for my stor ?
   When yo create a "stor", following parameters are specified,
     MIN-COPY: // default 2
     MAX-COPY: // default 16
   I will make keep at least MIN-COPY, and depending on available
   free space, available network bandwidth and system load, server
   may keep upto MAX-COPY.

2. How do I check how many copy of this file exists and whereabouts ?
   # pumkin stor locate-file <file path>
   It will list you the files,
     <server1 name>/<server1 geographical location> <health status: IN-SYNC|SYNCING|OUT_OF_SYNC>
     <server2 name>/<server2 geographical location> <health status: IN-SYNC|SYNCING|OUT_OF_SYNC>
     ...
     <server1 name>/<server1 geographical location> <health status: IN-SYNC|SYNCING|OUT_OF_SYNC>
